## Abstract
Cervical cancer is the fourth cancer type most common and deadliest among women in the world,
being the thirds in Chile. Due to its current prevalence and impact on the society, multiple
efforts have been made for their early detection through tests. The pap smear test has been the
most commond screnning method used for the early detection against cervical cancer in the world.

However, this test as it’s a hand-operated method, suffers from high false positives cases, in
addition to lowers effective rate of analysis by cytotechnologist due to the complexity involved in
single-cell analysis. To solve this problem, multiple institutions have implemented content-based
image retrieval (CBIR) systems for computer-aided in the analysis process. Nevertheless, due to
new advances in the image quality and the large volume of date that generate this, CBIRs must
apply better algorithms to improve the performance.

This thesis proposed it’s focused on investigate, develop and implement an efficient and robust
CBIR for pap smear images. To achieve this, a novel generative neural network is proposed for
the feature extraction of images, which will be indexed a retrieval by a graph-based nearest
neighbor algorithm.

The proposed CBIR will be evaluated and validated over the datasets ISBI Challenges 2014-2015,
Herlev, SIPaKMeD and liquid-based cytology pap smear dataset, and will be compared with
multiples features extraction methods availables in the current state of the arts.

The CBIR results are expected to assist medical specialists in the pap smear test analysis.
